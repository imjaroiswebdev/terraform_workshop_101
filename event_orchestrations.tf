/*
  Event Orchestrations: 

  These are usually managed per team basis but can be done globally.
  It should be noted that the rules within the Event Orchestrations obey a top down approach

  i.e. the first rule is executed and will stop processing if there is a match, else 
  the remaining rules are processed in descending order.

  The following user roles can create/edit/delete Event Orchestrations:

  * User
  * Admin
  * Manager base roles and team roles. Manager team roles can create/edit/delete Event Orchestrations associated with their team.
  * Global Admin
  * Account Owner
